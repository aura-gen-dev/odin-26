# Pong
A (rather boring) version of Pong written in Odin/Raylib. It's not perfect and isn't all that fun to play (boo), but it is working!

## Goals
The high level goal of this project is to take some of the learnings from the Snake project (where I mostly just followed a tutorial) and create my own game from scratch. The specific goals are:

- Familiarize myself with the Odin language
- Learn how to use Raylib
- Get some basic game functionality working
