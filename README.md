# Odin 26

26 games written in the [Odin programming language](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin), one for each letter of the alphabet.

## What's this about?
I remember hearing a story about how John Romero of id Software fame had learned to program games better by making a week for some period of time. I've been wanting to learn game programming myself and thought this might be a good way of doing so. And thus Odin 26 was born. I'm not timeboxing each game (because I have other work/life obligations), but in general, a week is the goal (at max).
